# Caesar Cipher

A simple encryption technique that swaps a letter in plain text with a letter that is a fixed number down in the alphabet. The user will input the sentence they wish to encrypt and the program will output the encrypted sentence. Only the letters in the sentence will be encrypted, leaving special characters alone.
